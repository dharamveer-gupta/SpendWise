# SpendWise

## üìå Overview
SpendWise is an **offline-first expense tracking app** built with **Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, Room, MVVM, Hilt, WorkManager**.  
It allows users to add, view, filter, group, and report expenses with support for **CSV/PDF export** and mock offline sync.

## ü§ñ AI Usage Summary
During development, I used **ChatGPT** as a coding assistant to:
- Scaffold the project structure (MVVM + Clean Architecture).
- Generate Room entities, DAOs, ViewModels, and Composables faster.
- Debug issues like **infinite loading in Flow collectors** and dependency mismatches.
- Add extra features like validation, export, and WorkManager mock sync.

I also referred to **GitHub Copilot** occasionally for autocomplete suggestions inside IDE.  
All AI-generated code was **reviewed, tested, and refactored** manually.
